# Developer Architecture Overview

This shall give a sufficiently good overview over the haskell.nix
ideas, such that a new developer can navigate around without too
much trouble.

## Packages

`haskell.nix` is centered around packages (haskell package
descriptions as nix-expressions). These are generated by
`cabal-to-nix` from the `nix-tools` package. `stack-to-nix` and
`plan-to-nix` will delegate the transformation of cabal packages to
nix expressions to the same code that `cabal-to-nix` uses.

These packages will look similar to the following:

```nix
