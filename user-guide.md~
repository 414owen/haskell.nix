# User Guide

So you want to use `haskell.nix` with your stack or cabal project. The
general appraoch will be to pick the right tool from `nix-tools` and
produce a `pkgs.nix` expressions.  Getting a copy of the haskell.nix,
hackage.nix (and potentially stackage.nix) source will then equip us
to produce derivations that we can `nix build`.
